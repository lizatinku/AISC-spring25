# 🏎️ F1 Race Predictor

**F1 Race Predictor** is a machine learning-powered web app that predicts Formula 1 race results using real qualifying times, circuit data, and historical performance metrics. It is built during the AISC Beginner Projects 6-week sprint to explore ML pipelines end-to-end — from data to deployment.

## 🔍 What It Does

Based on the selected:
- **Circuit**
- **Tyre Compound**
- **(Optional)** Weather inclusion

…the model predicts finishing times for drivers using qualifying session data and historical lap/sector times. The leaderboard updates in real time, giving a sense of how qualifying performance translates to actual race outcomes.
